# What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

Through learning R in the past three months, I got to know that R is such a powerful programming language in data science, and useful in data analysis and statistics. By using R in statistics, data analysis becomes easy and saves lots of time in statistics. Here are some thoughts on why I will continue to use R.

1) Diverse packages in R enrich the functions of R, with the packages, it’s easier to analyze data, and create different visualizations such as figures, plots, tables, and so on.

2) By using R, the data can be reshaped, selected, preprocessed, and changed the format of data, which makes it suitable for analysis. 

3) With R, machine learning, statistical modeling, predictive models, and statistical analysis can be performed; In addition, APP can be created with R, it’s pretty useful and easier. 

Besides the above thoughts, there are some advantages of R that make statistics and data manipulation powerful and useful.



# what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

After learning R, I have more choices to handle data, working on statistics, and coming to know how to create APPs. At this time, I should be able to work in different ways in statistics and create an APP with Shiny by myself.

In statistics, I will work on data analysis with calculators and can not handle large data. With R, the data can be analyzed in an easier way, perform complex analyses and create different visualizations. 

With Shiny, I will create an APP with different applications, and share them remotely, it’s useful and has applications in diverse fields.


# what areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring further?  

Through the R study, I got to know the basics of it and applied it to data analysis, while it still needs more practice and time to master R and put it into more applications. I will spend more time on the areas such as machine learning and model fitting, since which are pretty useful and powerful in data analysis.
 
 
 ## Blog Post Title From First Header

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
